# LendingClub-Loan-Analysis

In the Lending club case, we need to analysis financial loss for bank and lending comapny. We need to identify the risk from the loan applicant so that we could reduce the the NPA (Non performing Asset) for the loan.

We are looking at the Loan disbursal data for a large Online consumer finance company. The data contains ongoing loans, Fully paid and charged-off cases. Along with this various customer related data.

The objective is to look at the existing cutomer data and using Exploratory Data Analysis find what attributes can be used to predict/discern final loan disposition i.e. will they be fully paid or charge off. This will help us in managing risk and taking pre-emptive steps where necessary.
